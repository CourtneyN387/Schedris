# Schedris - Schedule Advisor

This Schedule Advisor project was developed by a team of 5 following Agile Methodology, where I served as both a Developer as well as the Scrum Master. Collaboratively, we built the web application using Python and Django, incorporating features such as course search, schedule creation, and advisor approval. Throughout the development process, we followed agile practices, including iterative development, regular sprint planning, and frequent communication. By adopting this approach, we were able to efficiently manage the project, ensure effective teamwork, and deliver a high-quality application that simplifies class registration for UVA students.
